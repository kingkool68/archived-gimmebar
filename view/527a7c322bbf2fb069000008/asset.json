I\u2019m the guy who has told an endless number of people that the redesign of Rands has been just around the corner for the last six years and it\u2019s never happened. There have been no less than three designers who have contributed work to designs that simply never happened, and I apologize to each and every one of you. But each design contributed to what you see now \u2013 a completely new version of the site.\nThis final iteration is entirely the fault of my good friend Alex King . Several years ago, Alex was one of the unlucky participants in a \u201cHey, can you help with me with a redesign?\u201d false start, and to his credit he still speaks to me. This July, he contacted me and wrote:\n\u201cYou mind if I put together a wireframe or two for your consideration?  Scratch that \u2013 I\u2019m excited about the ideas so I will be putting together the rough wireframes \u2013 and I\u2019ll send them to you.\u201d\nAlex\u2019s initial concepts were a marriage of the design elements I loved from the old site \u2013 typography, color palette \u2013 with a goal for the new site: a focus on the words. While I love the old site like an old beat-up leather jacket that I\u2019ll never throw away, it was accreting cruft. As I look at each piece of cruft, I remember my decision to put it there, but when I look at the whole, I\u2019ve been slowly losing focus on the words.\nEverything is Different\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s changed:\nI believe the new site is incredibly readable on a big screen, tablet, or phone. If you don\u2019t believe me, resize this window and see how responsive design provides a pleasant reading experience regardless of window size.\nAfter a good long run on Movable Type, the site is now run on the latest version of WordPress. My site is not fancy and has happily served up static pages for years. This static page strategy made the site resilient to a variety of traffic conditions. While I\u2019m assured that WordPress\u2019s scalability issues are long gone, I won\u2019t actually believe it until the new site handles the load.\nI\u2019m often asked why I chose to put post dates for article at the bottom of the pieces. The people who ask are in a hurry and mostly care only whether the content is new rather than good. There are over 400 articles of greatly varying quality and some are fortunate enough to stand the test of time. For this redesign, a significant amount of work was done to make it easier to stumble upon this content. In addition to spending time categorizing existing articles, I\u2019ve also combined and added new categories to make it easier to find articles. My favorite new category is Tools , which documents my obsession with pens, paper, coffee mugs, and, soon, conference badges.\nFrequent readers have noted that I\u2019ve gone from three or four articles a month to maybe one or two. I\u2019ve developed irrational emotional baggage about what constitutes a Rands article and I want to write more. While I believe long form articles are the bread and butter of this site, I\u2019ve created a new Excerpt type that enables me to post much smaller pieces without the word count and editing requirements of the long form pieces. As I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll use Excerpts, there is a finite chance you may hate these smaller posts, which is why we\u2019ve developed two different feeds for the site:\nEverything is what you see on the Blog page and contains, well, everything.\nLong form is just the long form pieces \u2013 you\u2019ll always see the latest long piece on the front page of the site.\nIf RSS isn\u2019t your thing, there is a mailing list where I\u2019ll continue the practice of announcing long form pieces and occasionally asking for help on site redesigns. @rands will still announce long form articles, but @rands_briefly will announce all new content.\nLastly, there\u2019s the Sandbox. The Sandbox has been a part of each redesign I\u2019ve never finished and I\u2019m very happy to finally land this simple concept. In addition to providing jumps to various useful content on the site, it also documents what I consider to be additional Rands canon: the Twitter and Instagram accounts. A Sandbox is where you play, I play on Twitter and Instagram, and you should come play, too.\nA Little Bit of Sadness\nThis is the fifth revision to the site, but this is the first time someone else has done a majority of the heavy lifting. It\u2019s been a point of pride for me that I\u2019ve been responsible for every single part of the site save for the hosting , but it\u2019s precisely this pride which has prevented the site from evolving.\nAlex and his team at Crowd Favorite borrowed elements from the existing design, but re-implemented the WordPress design from scratch utilizing their responsive CSS grid and Carrington Core templating framework. What they\u2019ve crafted is a site where all of the content is deftly managed inside of the WordPress application. Work that was a pain in Movable Type is an afterthought in WordPress. Additionally, the site infrastructure is deliciously stored in git, which, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, is my first opportunity to really use git. Don\u2019t judge.\nWhen Alex mailed me with his ideas for wireframes in July, I had no credible plan to launch a new version of Rands, let alone a modern, mobile-friendly site that not only provides creative options for the future, but also excavates over ten years of content buried in the archives . Sure, I\u2019d been asking for help from designers and developers, but I wasn\u2019t getting enough help because I wasn\u2019t delegating enough.\nIf delegating doesn\u2019t hurt, you\u2019re getting less done than you could.\nWelcome to new site. I\u2019d love to hear what you think. I\u2019m certain things are broken and I\u2019d appreciate your patience while I fix them. Lastly, thanks for a being a reader. I\u2019ve got more to say, and thanks to Alex and Crowd Favorite, I have a modern platform where I can say it and this brings me great joy.\n#\n",
