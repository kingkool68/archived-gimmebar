		<p>The job description says publisher, president and CEO.</p>
		 
		<p>But that doesn't really capture it. A more complete job title would be: mentor, adviser, cheerleader, thinker, marketer, creator, dreamer, entrepreneur and, occasionally, carrier of the sandbags.</p>
		 
		<p>We're looking for a pioneer.</p>
		 
		<p>We're searching for someone who's obsessive about journalism and the business of producing it. We do things a little differently here at the Emerald and in Oregon. Last year, <a href="http://future.dailyemerald.com/">we completely rebuilt the Emerald</a> to adapt from a traditional college newspaper to a modern college media company.</p>
		 
		<p>We're looking for someone who can take what we started with the Revolution, and grow it into something even bigger and better.</p>

		<p><a href="https://d28x51nrej5way.cloudfront.net/documents/emerald_president_job_description.pdf">Here's the complete job description.</a></p>
		 
		<p>A note about the newsroom: The Emerald's student editor in chief is responsible for all the company's editorial content. The president has no authority or responsibility for the editorial content of the Emerald's news products.</p>
		 
		<p>The editor in chief is hired by the board of directors and is a peer of the president on the organizational chart. The president and editor in chief operate as a team to run the company.</p>

		<h2>The Emerald</h2>
		
		<p>The Emerald is an independent nonprofit media company. We have served the University of Oregon with news and information since 1900. Our mission is to train students, serve the UO community and run a financially sustainable nonprofit business.</p>
		 
		<p>The Emerald produces a <a href="http://oregondigital.org/digcol/ode/">news magazine in print twice a week</a> and <a href="http://dailyemerald.com">online news 24/7</a>. But we do a bunch of other stuff, too: Marketing, events, advertising and tech ventures. Our students work for The Oregonian, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Chicago Tribune, Nike, GQ, Google, Facebook, Amazon.</p>
		 
		<p>In 2013, the Emerald's Revolution <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/05/why-we-killed-our-college-daily-paper-for-a-more-digital-future145/">transitioned the company from a traditional newspaper to a modern college media company</a>. College Media Matters, the leading college newspaper blog, <a href="http://www.collegemediamatters.com/2013/05/23/college-newspaper-of-the-year-2012-2013-the-emerald-university-of-oregon-2/">named the Emerald the 2013-14 college newspaper of the year</a>. Our Revolution has also been covered by <a href="http://www.oregonquarterly.com/summer2012/feature4.php">Oregon Quarterly</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/college-newspapers-digital-innovate_n_1687528.html">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/06/why-the-oregon-daily-emerald-is-transforming-what-it-means-to-be-a-college-newspaper/">Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab</a>, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-13/what-media-companies-could-learn-from-a-student-newspaper">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>, <a href="http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/ccp/college-newspaper-circulation-drops-as-digital-media-use-grows">USA Today College</a> and industry analysts and groups, including <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/05/5-lessons-from-the-oregon-daily-emeralds-digital-reinvention152/">PBS MediaShift</a>, <a href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/journalism-education/215717/student-newspapers-facing-the-same-pressures-as-pro-publications/">Poynter</a>, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/12/the-newsonomics-of-college-news-innovation/">Ken Doctor</a> and <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/tag/emerald-media/">Steve Buttry</a>. The Emerald is a finalist for a <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/npm13.html">newspaper</a> and 		<a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/opm13.html">online</a> Pacemaker award from the Associated Collegiate Press &mdash; the Pulitzer Prize of college journalism.

		<h2>The Oregon way</h2>

		<p>We think different here.</p>
		 
		<p>The state tagline used to be: "We love dreamers."</p>
		 
		<p>Iconic former Gov. Tom McCall &mdash; an Emerald alum &mdash; made Oregon a national leader in the 1970s environmental movement with the bottle bill, beach bill and land-use laws.</p>
		 
		<p>Nike founder Phil Knight &mdash; also an Emerald alum &mdash; revolutionized shoes, sports and marketing.</p>
		 
		<p>In 1966, Emerald managing editor <a href="http://www.oregonquarterly.com/autumn2013/feature1.php">Annette Buchanan refused to disclose her sources to the local district attorney</a>. Her fight led the Legislature to create Oregon's first Shield Law.</p>
		 
		<p>Former Emerald editor Paul Brainerd grew up to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/31/business/company-news-aldus-founder-to-give-up-two-jobs.html">"father of desktop publishing," according to The New York Times</a>. Then there's the University of Oregon's football program: Fast, fashionable and, often, first.</p>
		 
		<p>Oregon is home for pioneers. If you're one, too, this can be your next home.</p>
